# Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.

The main purpose of this project is to develop an API in charge of certain task of a fictional Vocational training center / school.

Nowadays, it is desirable for any public or private entity with an educational or formative vocation to adhere to the new formula of delivering their courses that would allow that institution to put their contents online to overcome the problems of congestion within their classes and extend their geographical scope anyone who is interested around the world can take their course via online or on location.
This API will help student to enrol in a class, get their results / grade. Instructor will be able to grade their student and API has an Admin who will be in charge of creating classes and assign instructors to them. There is much to improve on this API in future. 

# Why is it a problem that needs solving?

The original intention of this API was to create something that will help me to learn and feel more comfortable with Python and web development. With other skills I will get in next term my plan is to make this functional and any school in need may use it. We will add more task 

# Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?

I chose to develop this API using PostgreSQL as my database system because of many reasons here are some:  

- Postgres is an open-source DB
- Highly extensible
- It is easy to deal with complex data types like geodata for GPS
- Flexible text search 
- Ability to create functions, triggers, data types etc. 
- Supports JSON 
- It’ is cross-platform 

Here are some desadvantages:

- Not available by default on all hosts 
- It is a bit slower compared to other RDBMS’s speed
